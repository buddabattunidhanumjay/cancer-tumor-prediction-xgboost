# cancer-tumor-prediction-xgboost
Cancer Tumor Classification using XGBoost: Built a model to classify tumors as benign or malignant with 96.5% accuracy. Applied preprocessing, feature selection, EDA (Seaborn, Matplotlib), and evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for reliable predictions.

# 🧬 Cancer Tumor Classification Using XGBoost

This internship project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer dataset. It highlights how data preprocessing and supervised learning can support early cancer detection.

## 📁 Dataset
Used a structured dataset (`cancer.csv`) containing clinical features and tumor classifications.

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- **Modeling**: Built an XGBoost classifier with **96.5% accuracy**.
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
- **EDA**: Visualized data distributions and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📎 Files

- `survaival analysis - cancer prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook  
- `cancer.csv` – Input dataset

## ✅ Results

- Achieved high classification performance.
- Reliable detection of malignant tumors with minimal false negatives.
